Zimbra Public License, Version 1.3 (ZPL)
----------------------------------------

This Zimbra Public License (this "Agreement") is a legal agreement that describes the
terms under which VMware, Inc., a Delaware corporation having its principal place of
business at 3401 Hillview Avenue, Palo Alto, California 94304 ("VMware") will provide
software to you via download or otherwise ("Software"). By using the Software, you,
an individual or an entity ("You") agree to the terms of this Agreement.

In consideration of the mutual promises and upon the terms and conditions set forth
below, the parties agree as follows:

    1. Grant of Copyright License
        1.1 - Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, VMware hereby grants
              to You, under any and all of its copyright interest in and to the Software,
              a royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to copy, modify,
              compile, execute, and distribute the Software and Modifications. For the
              purposes of this Agreement, any change to, addition to, or abridgement of
              the Software made by You is a "Modification;" however, any file You add to
              the Software that does not contain any part of the Software is not a
              "Modification."
        1.2 - If You are an individual acting on behalf of a corporation or other entity,
              Your use of the Software or any Modification is subject to Your having the
              authority to bind such corporation or entity to this Agreement. Providing
              copies to persons within such corporation or entity is not considered
              distribution for purposes of this Agreement.
        1.3 - For the Software or any Modification You distribute in source code format,
              You must do so only under the terms of this Agreement, and You must include
              a complete copy of this Agreement with Your distribution. With respect to
              any Modification You distribute in source code format, the terms of this
              Agreement will apply to You in the same way those terms apply to VMware with
              respect to the Software. In other words, when You are distributing Modifications
              under this Agreement, You "stand in the shoes" of VMware in terms of the
              rights You grant and how the terms and conditions apply to You and the
              licensees of Your Modifications. Notwithstanding the foregoing, when You
              "stand in the shoes" of VMware, You are not subject to the jurisdiction
              provision under Section 7, which requires all disputes under this Agreement
              to be subject to the jurisdiction of federal or state courts of northern
              California.
        1.4 - For the Software or any Modification You distribute in compiled or object
              code format, You must also provide recipients with access to the Software
              or Modification in source code format along with a complete copy of this
              Agreement. The distribution of the Software or Modifications in compiled
              or object code format may be under a license of Your choice, provided that
              You are in compliance with the terms of this Agreement. In addition, You
              must make absolutely clear that any license terms applying to such Software
              or Modification that differ from this Agreement are offered by You alone
              and not by VMware, and that such license does not restrict recipients from
              exercising rights in the source code to the Software granted by VMware under
              this Agreement or rights in the source code to any Modification granted by
              You as described in Section 1.3.
        1.5 - This Agreement does not limit Your right to distribute files that are entirely
              Your own work (i.e., which do not incorporate any portion of the Software and
              are not Modifications) under any terms You choose.
    2. Support
        VMware has no obligation to provide technical support or updates to You. Nothing in
        this Agreement requires VMware to enter into any license with You for any other
        edition of the Software.
    3. Intellectual Property Rights
        3.1 - Except for the license expressly granted under copyright in Section 1.1,
              no rights, licenses or forbearances are granted or may arise in relation to
              this Agreement whether expressly, by implication, exhaustion, estoppel or
              otherwise. All rights, including all intellectual property rights, that are
              not expressly granted under this Agreement are hereby reserved.
        3.2 - In any copy of the Software or in any Modification you create, You must
              retain and reproduce, any and all copyright, patent, trademark, and
              attribution notices that are included in the Software in the same form
              as they appear in the Software. This includes the preservation of
              attribution notices in the form of trademarks or logos that exist within
              a user interface of the Software.
        3.3 - This license does not grant You rights to use any party's name, logo, or
              trademarks, except solely as necessary to comply with Section 3.2.
    4. Disclaimer of Warranties
        THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. VMWARE MAKES
        NO WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY REGARDING OR RELATING TO
        THE SOFTWARE. SPECIFICALLY, VMWARE DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL BE
        ERROR FREE OR WILL PERFORM IN AN UNINTERRUPTED MANNER. TO THE GREATEST EXTENT
        ALLOWED BY LAW, VMWARE SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
        MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE (EVEN IF VMWARE HAD BEEN
        INFORMED OF SUCH PURPOSE), AND NONINFRINGEMENT WITH RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE,
        ANY MODIFICATIONS THERETO AND WITH RESPECT TO THE USE OF THE FOREGOING.
    5. Limitation of Liability
        IN NO EVENT WILL VMWARE BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
        EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION
        LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF USE, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF DATA, COST OF COVER)
        IN CONNECTION WITH OR ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE FURNISHING, PERFORMANCE
        OR USE OF THE SOFTWARE OR ANY OTHER RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, WHETHER ALLEGED
        AS A BREACH OF CONTRACT OR TORTIOUS CONDUCT, INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE, AND EVEN IF
        VMWARE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
    6. Term and Termination
        6.1 - This Agreement will continue in effect unless and until terminated
              earlier pursuant to this Section 6.
        6.2 - In the event You violate the terms of this Agreement, VMware may
              terminate this Agreement.
        6.3 - All licenses granted hereunder shall terminate upon the termination
              of this Agreement. Termination will be in addition to any rights and
              remedies available to VMware at law or equity or under this Agreement.
        6.4 - Termination of this Agreement will not affect the provisions regarding
              reservation of rights (Section 3.1), provisions disclaiming or limiting
              VMware's liability (Sections 4 and 5), Termination (Section 6) or
              Miscellaneous (Section 7), which provisions will survive termination
              of this Agreement.
    7. Miscellaneous
        This Agreement contains the entire agreement of the parties with respect to
        the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes all previous communications,
        representations, understandings and agreements, either oral or written, between
        the parties with respect to said subject matter. The relationship of the parties
        hereunder is that of independent contractors, and this Agreement will not be
        construed as creating an agency, partnership, joint venture or any other form
        of legal association between the parties. If any term, condition, or provision
        in this Agreement is found to be invalid, unlawful or unenforceable to any extent,
        this Agreement will be construed in a manner that most closely effectuates the
        intent of this Agreement. Such invalid term, condition or provision will be
        severed from the remaining terms, conditions and provisions, which will continue
        to be valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law. This Agreement
        will be interpreted and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
        California and the United States of America, without regard to conflict of law
        principles. The U.N. Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods
        shall not apply to this Agreement. All disputes arising out of this Agreement
        involving VMware or any of its subsidiaries shall be subject to the jurisdiction
        of the federal or state courts of northern California, with venue lying in Santa
        Clara County, California. No rights may be assigned, no obligations may be
        delegated, and this Agreement may not be transferred by You, in whole or in part,
        whether voluntary or by operation of law, including by way of sale of assets,
        merger or consolidation, without the prior written consent of VMware, and any
        purported assignment, delegation or transfer without such consent shall be void
        ab initio. Any waiver of the provisions of this Agreement or of a party's rights
        or remedies under this Agreement must be in writing to be effective. Failure,
        neglect or delay by a party to enforce the provisions of this Agreement or its
        rights or remedies at any time, will not be construed or be deemed to be a
        waiver of such party's rights under this Agreement and will not in any way
        affect the validity of the whole or any part of this Agreement or prejudice
        such party's right to take subsequent action.
